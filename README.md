#  Spam SMS Detection (Machine Learning Project)

This project detects spam messages using a Naïve Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization.

##  Steps:
1. Preprocess SMS data (cleaning, vectorization)
2. Train a Naïve Bayes classifier
3. Achieved **97.4% accuracy**
4. Saved model for real-time spam detection

## Files:
- `spam_classifier.pkl` → Trained spam detection model
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` → TF-IDF feature extractor
- `spam.csv` → Dataset used for training
